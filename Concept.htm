<p>In TriviaTime, we are changing the concept of the current gameplay to offer an improved experience.</p>
<h1>Question</h1>
<p>&lt;Glime&gt; .001. <strong>Alcohol: Name That drink: Kosak’s ____?</strong></p>
<p>&lt;Glime&gt; 1st Hint: ****</p>
<p>The goal of this new theme is to bold the most important information to make the question output as simple as possible. A change from the current theme is that we will not include the question score. Hints separated by ten seconds, instead of 15.</p>
<h1>KAOS</h1>
<p>&lt;Glime&gt; .K001. <strong>What are some popular ice cream flavors?</strong> 14 possible answers possible</p>
<p>&lt;Glime&gt; 1st Hint: <strong>[***** ****] [**** ******** ****] [** ****** *****] [***** ****] [**** ******** ****] [** ****** *****] [***** ****] [**** ******** ****] [** ****** *****] [***** ****] [**** ******** ****] [** ****** *****] [**** ******** ****] [** ****** *****] </strong></p>
<p>Again, here, only the important information is included and in bold. Point values are left out. After a question is answered and before the next hint, a command will be available to view the remaining answers (currently: ,).</p>
<h1>Points</h1>
<p>To even the playing field, we are changing the way points work. Each question will be worth the same amount of points, instead of a point range (such as 100 – 900). A bonus for questions will be a set amount. KAOS answers will be the same way. The KAOS bonus will also be a set amount. This offers a far advantage to all players. Bonus questions are not planned.</p>
<h1>Database(s)</h1>
<p>We plan on keeping track of players’ scores by their usernames. Should they want to change usernames and keep their scores, they will need to register to the bot. Supybots are already capable of keeping track of users across nicknames and hosts (per owner’s configuration), so why reinvent the wheel? SQLite will be used for the database(s).</p>
<p><strong>Keeping track of questions</strong></p>
<p>Store question in an SQL file. Create a system of assigning number to the question. That question number will only be used for reporting and when the question is displayed by the bot. If the question is reported, it will be assigned a new number for reporting. When edited, it will use the new report number.</p>
<h1>Streaks</h1>
<p>Once a player begins a streak, the point value will increase by .01% on each question for that player only. For example, if 500 points are awarded for each question, a streak of two would reward 505 points, then 510, 515, 520, 525, 530, etc. Up to 2x its original value. If the streak is broken by another player, that player is awarded 500 points and can start a new streak for themselves. If the game stops, the streak will still continue when it starts again. <span style="color: #888888;">Alternative approach: increase by just one point only each time. Other ideas: After a streak of five, a bonus will be issued as well as points increasing each time.</span></p>
<h1>On the Web (Reporting, Fixing, and Web Stats)</h1>
<p>Reports will automatically be published to a PHP webpage. Once the report has been fixed, it will be automatically moved to a Fixed page. The report will include who reported it, and the fixed version will include who fixed it. Counts will be kept public and live of how many questions each player has reported and fixed. Web Stats will also be kept on a PHP webpage by pulling the information directly from the database.</p>
<h1>Reporting</h1>
<p>If a report is done properly using regex, it will be corrected and saved automatically. As the question cycle comes to an end users will be reminded to fix their reports. Reports will be removed once they have been fixed and verified by someone else.</p>
<h1>Enhanced Administration</h1>
<p>Unlike BogusTrivia, TriviaTime will make it easier to make changes to the bot. Settings can be changed within the supybot online and have changes applied in real time. They will also be able to increase/decrease player scores, migrate player scores, delete players, <span style="color: #888888;">change player level, award badges&nbsp;<span style="color: #333333;">and</span> </span><span style="color: #333333;">prohibit a player from earning points.</span></p>
<h1>Minor details</h1>
<p>The game will no longer start automatically. It will stop after ten minutes of silence in the channel. There will no longer be an on-join greeting. Flood protection will be enabled by default.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #888888;">New KAOS</span></h1>
<p>This is still an idea. Instead of offering all possible answers at the beginning of the KAOS, instead, only ten (randomly chosen) answers will be available. As the players near getting all ten (such as 8 answered), more answers will be offered and the time will be expanded.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #888888;">Levels</span></h1>
<p>This is still an idea. After a certain number of points have been reached, or after a certain number of questions have been answered, the player will move up a level. Also consider: increase streak multiplier as you level up? How many points should a player be awarded?</p>
<h1><span style="color: #888888;">Badges</span></h1>
<p>This is still an idea. Doing certain actions will award the player a badge. Badges are permanent and can be viewed on the website. Ideal uses are for fixing/adding/editing questions, being active, being around for a while, reaching a certain amount of points.</p>
