<p>Please note the differences in numbers. There is the round number, report number, question number, edit number, delete number, and a temporary number. You will only need to know the<strong> round number, report number,</strong> and <strong>question number</strong>. <em>Round number</em> is the number displayed next to the question in the channel. The questions are selected at random from the database, and then assigned a round number for tracking. The <em>question number</em> is the ID for the question in the database. The <em>report number</em> is just the number for the reports, it does not correspond with a question directly.&nbsp;<strong>When reporting questions, you will need to know the round number. When fixing questions, you may need the report number, but you will always need the question number.</strong>&nbsp;The edit number and the temporary number are only used those approving edits and new questions.</p>
<p>We hold our questions to a high standard. When you are adding or editing questions, please follow the guidelines below to ensure your edit or addition it approved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions should have a category. Sub-categories are not necessary.</li>
<li>Questions should not be easily guessed by the hints given. Think about how the answer will display in the hints for the question, and adjust accordingly.</li>
<li>The fewer the words in an answer, the better.</li>
<li>Questions should not become a guessing game. Avoid multiple choice (such as colors, dates, years, etc).</li>
<li>We have enough questions about Canada already.</li>
<li>Proposed questions should be appropriate for all audiences and interesting.</li>
<li>Avoid long questions.</li>
<li>Each question should be verifiable. There should be evidence for the question online.</li>
<li>Questions with fill-in-the-blanks should use the standard of five underscores, "_____" (without quotations).</li>
<li>KAOS need to have at least 10 answers, preferably only 10.
</ul>
<p>If you see a question that is not up to par to our expectations, please either report it, edit it, or delete it (if it can't be salvaged by editing).</p>
<p>The following are the categories we would like to sort our questions into. Please edit questions accordingly.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title" id="fix">Fix Questions</h1></div>
<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: center;">Fixing questions is a very simple process, and we would greatly appreciate it if you would like to help out. It doesn’t take long and everyone benefits from each question fixed.</p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p><strong>First</strong>, <a href="http://trivialand.org/register/">register </a>on Glime.&nbsp;<strong>Then</strong>, follow the instructions below to edit a question. You may edit any questions, even questions that haven’t been reported.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">Editing Reported Questions</h1>
<p>Questions reported by trivia players will need to be fixed. You will need to message Glime with the <strong>listreports</strong> command. Make sure to include the channel. It should look like this: <em>/msg Glime listreports #trivialand</em>. To view more details about the report, use the <strong>showreport</strong> command. <strong>You will need to specify the channel number and the report number.</strong> Once you find a question you’d like to edit, you can use the <strong>edit</strong> command. You will need to specify the question number and the corrected version of the question (along with the answer). Here’s an example of the process in action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1227 aligncenter" alt="photo" src="./questions_style/photo.jpg" width="263" height="300" pagespeed_url_hash="1068338053"></p>
<p>Once the edit is accepted, the edited question will replace the former question, and the report will be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Editing Question Without Reporting</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to report a question to edit it. There are two ways to fix a question this way. You can do this by reporting with regex. By reporting with regex, Glime will automatically make the changes to the question and submit it for approval immediately. You will need to know regex to use this reporting method. When you report the question, include the regex after the round number. It should look like this: <em>.report 94854 s/cheese/bacon/</em> Glime will send you two messages, and reply back in the channel noting that regex was used.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1229 aligncenter" alt="photo" src="./questions_style/photo1.jpg" width="300" height="67" pagespeed_url_hash="1903230822"></p>
<p>That’s all you need to do. It is much simpler and quicker to use regex than to report without it, so please try to use this method as much as possible (so long as you know how to use it).</p>
<h1 class="entry-title" id="add">Add Questions</h1>
<p>Ready to make trivia more interesting? By submitting your questions, not only will the overall question quality improve, but you will have an advantage since you already know the answers! Read below on how to submit your questions.</p>
<p>Message Glime the <strong>question</strong> (question mark not necessary), followed by an <strong>asterisk</strong>, then the <strong>answer</strong> (and any other answers, also seperated by an asterisk). Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>/msg Glime TriviaTime add Planets: What is our planet called*Earth</strong></p>
<p>For multiple answers:</p>
<p><strong>/msg Glime TriviaTime add Presidents: What is the name of our president*Barack Obama*Obama*President Obama</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, for KAOS questions:</p>
<p><strong>/msg Glime TriviaTime add KAOS: What were the most popular names in 2012*Amanda*Adam*Kyle*Kylie*Jordan</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for submitting the questions! They will enter into circulation once they are approved.</p>
<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;">Thank-you for the help! It means a lot to all of us. Those who’ve edited at least 100 questions are eligible for an&nbsp;<a title="Cloaks" href="http://trivialand.org/cloaks/">editor cloak</a>. In future versions of TriviaTime, you will also receive a badge!</strong></p>
